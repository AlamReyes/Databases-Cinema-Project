# Databases-Cinema-Project
An integral implementation of databases (SQL) for a cinema project, including analysis, models, etc.


### Cinema Projection System Database

This project aims to develop a comprehensive **Information System** for a company dedicated to the commercialization and maintenance of cinema projectors. The system facilitates the management of content that will be exhibited in various cinemas where the company distributes its products. Moreover, the system provides a platform for cinemas to manage their own schedules and programming.

#### Key Features:
- **Cinema Management**: Store detailed information about each cinema, including identification, contact details, and geolocation.
- **Room Configuration**: Manage multiple rooms within a cinema, with data on capacity, opening hours, technical specifications (digital or 3D support), and session intervals.
- **Content Management**: Handle various types of content, such as movies or live broadcasts (e.g., concerts, sports events, operas). Content is categorized and stored with detailed metadata, including genres, distributors, and production countries.
- **Event Scheduling**: Ensure that scheduled events do not overlap in time or location, following strict business rules. 
- **Dynamic Cartel Management**: Offer the ability to manage, publish, and view cinema schedules and cartels, while ensuring that no event is scheduled before the official release date of the content.

#### My Contributions:
As part of the database development, I was responsible for the following technical tasks:
1. **Conceptual Modeling**: Created detailed conceptual models for each entity and relationship using **DIA**, providing a clear and concise representation of the data structure.
2. **Logical Design**: Translated the conceptual models into logical designs that align with the system's requirements.
3. **Data Dictionary**: Developed a comprehensive data dictionary, which includes definitions of all data elements within the system.
4. **Database Normalization**: Applied normalization techniques to ensure the integrity and efficiency of the database structure, reducing redundancy and dependency.
5. **Database Design**: Designed and implemented **DCL (Data Control Language)**, **DDL (Data Definition Language)**, and **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** components, including queries, triggers, and transaction management.
6. **Queries and Transactions**: Developed a series of complex queries and transactions, ensuring the data flow supports all business logic.
7. **Triggers and Inserts**: Automated business processes through triggers and managed data population with optimized insert statements.

This project represents a solid foundation for a cinema content management system, delivering a structured and optimized database ready for future integration into the companyâ€™s larger software infrastructure.
